Parts List for the Stackable 6502 Computer
==========================================

There is no kit that you can buy yet for this design, but if you have
already built or plan to build [Ben Eater's Breadboard 6502 Computer](https://eater.net/6502), then most of the components can be gotten from his kits.
Build the breadboard version first, following his
[instructions on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH).
Then solder up a permanent one using the same parts plus a few extras!

You will need at least the basic "6502 Computer Kit", the
"6502 Serial Interface Kit", and of course an "EEPROM Programmer".
I have marked the parts that you can get from Ben's kits with (BE) below.
